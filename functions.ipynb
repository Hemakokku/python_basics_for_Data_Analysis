    "# Discover Functions\n",
    "During your data analysis, you will regularly have to use groups of statements several times for a very specific purpose. One of the fundamental principles for any computer programmer is to get maximum results for minimum effort (there is even a saying that a good programmer is a lazy programmer!). It is thanks to this somewhat \"lazy\" but very effective principle that the idea of functions came about. Functions can group several statements in a block which will be called using a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are not specific to Python; they are present in all computer languages. They can:\n",
    "\n",
    "reuse a portion of code already written just by stating the function nameâ€”so you don't have to rewrite the whole portion of code each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "simplify code and make it more readable!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many pre-existing functions in Python! In addition to those already seen, there are, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "len() :  a function that returns the length of an item. Do you remember strings? Using this function on a string tells you how many characters the string contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "type() : lets you print the type of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "pow(a, b) : lets you calculate a to the power of b. It is equivalent to writing a**b.\n",
    "\n",
    "abs() :  returns the absolute value of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples to illustrate the use of these functions:\n",
